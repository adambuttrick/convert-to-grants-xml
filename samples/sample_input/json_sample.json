      "summary_nl": "The research aims to support the development of the multimodal transport system in the Netherlands, and by extension, in Europe, into a truly synchromodal transport system, in which infrastructure use, transport services and operations are perfectly aligned with market demand. This requires the integration of data on infrastructure, services and transportation, the development of new synchromodal control mechanisms, and the further analysis of demand characteristics of shippers. This project provides the academic underpinning of the ambition and innovation vision that is formulated for synchromodality in the Topsector Logistics. So far research has mainly addressed horizontal alignment between modes into a coherent network. The main research angle for this project is the vertical alignment, i.e. the shipper/client orientation and the relations with the underlying network management. In addition to the fact that these vertical relations constitute scientifically unexplored territory, we argue that they are of critical importance for the deployment of synchromodal transport services. In short, if service demand is difficult to predict and if capacity availability is uncertain, the synchromodal service market will not function. \nAcademic contributions include (1) improved freight modelling by improving the representation of shippers? supply chain considerations; (2) quantification of the impact of the level of information exchange and collaboration / competition among organizations on synchromodal planning and execution; (3) new real-time decision making approaches and pricing mechanisms for synchromodal solutions; and (4) the development of information concepts that enable ?data synchromodality?. \n",

Throughout my career I have been fascinated by complex patterning processes and have become an expert in the development of state-of-the-art integrative models to unravel pattern-forming mechanisms.\n\nPlants root architecture consists of a striking, spatially regular, left right alternating pattern of lateral roots along the main root. The resulting density, total number and size of lateral roots determine a plant's efficiency in taking up water and nutrients from the soil. Given the food-security challenges posed by climate change and a rising world population, a thorough understanding of lateral root patterning that would allow for more efficient methods to adjust plant root architecture to adverse environmental conditions is of paramount importance. However, seemingly disparate experimental observations have led to a major controversy on the possible mechanism behind lateral root patterning, and many competing hypotheses have been proposed. \n\nThe key aim of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive, mechanistic model of lateral root patterning, that simulates the dynamic patterning of root system architecture from the complex interplays between cell level gene expression, tissue level hormone transport and organ level growth processes. Such a model is urgently needed to explicitly test the different hypothesised mechanisms for root patterning and reconcile the seemingly disparate experimental observations. Furthermore, by iterating between modelling and experimentation these mechanisms will be validated and refined, thus allowing me to identify the root patterning mechanism at work in plants.

The mechanism we uncovered was subsequently validated experimentally with help from experimental collaborators.\n\n\n\nIn another part of the project we investigated how, after seed germination, a plant root awakenes, gradually increases its growth speed and then reaches a stable growth velocity. Again, we combined computational modeling with an experimental collaboration to decipher the underlying mechanism.",

Het mechanisme dat we met onze modellen ontdekt hebben hebben we vervolgens middels experimenten uitgevoerd door de experimenteel biologen waar we intensief mee samenwerken bevestigd.\n\n\n\nIn een ander deelproject hebben we onderzocht hoe, na de kieming van een zaadje, een plantenworteltje \"ontwaakt\" en steeds een beetje harder gaat groeien voordat het een constante groeisnelheid bereikt. Ook hier is een computermodel voor gebouwd en uitgebreid samengewerkt met experimenteel biologen."

This requires an efficient, always-available infrastructure. Growing environmental concerns also demand that the infrastructure is sustainable and uses resources cautiously.  Important results have been obtained in the design of algorithms for scheduling within data centers to reduce CO2 emissions. The idea is to minimize the amount of CO2 emitted per set of jobs to be run in a data center by appropriate temporal and spatial scheduling, privileging energy from renewable sources.",
      "summary_en": "De wereld van vandaag is een data-centrische wereld waarin men verwacht dat data overal beschikbaar is, op het juiste moment, op de juiste plaats, in de gewenste hoeveelheid, en verwerkt op een gepaste manier. Dit vereist een betrouwbare en efficiënte infrastructuur. Deze infrastructuur moet ook zuinig en duurzaam zijn vanwege de toenemende bezorgdheid om het milieu. Er zijn belangrijke resultaten geboekt in het ontwerpen van algoritmen voor het reduceren van de door datacenters veroorzaakte CO2 uitstoot. Deze algoritmen minimaliseren de CO2 uitstoot van workloads door ze op het optimale moment in plaats en tijd.",

In such an interconnected world organizations recognize the potential risk of experiencing a supply chain disruption. To be able to manage the unforeseen, supply chains need to develop resilience. While the importance of being resilient to sustainable operations is without question, it remains unclear how supply chain resilience can be achieved and balanced with the need for efficiency. This project explores the antecedents of resilience aiming to make the concept more tangible and implementable for organizations. The proposed research intends to identify and test what critical elements in relation to vertical, horizontal and diagonal coordination mechanisms should be taken into account and included into the design of highly optimized supply chains to make them more resilient based on the 4C approach. More specifically, we will conduct a number of exploratory case studies with our business partners, building on our current projects with, among others, ProRail/Dutch Railways. Insights from exploratory case studies will provide the basis for further experiments with decision-makers in both the laboratory and in the field. Furthermore, a management training tool will be developed to further acquire insights into supply chain resilience as well as help managers to better deal with uncertainty. Results will be valorized through annual workshops, lectures, involvement of students and the use by TNO of the training tool. ",

This is a novel theoretical and psychometric perspective in which psychological constructs, such as major depression, are conceptualized as networks of interacting components (e.g., insomnia &#8594; fatigue &#8594; concentration problems). In network theory, each individual may have a unique network structure (e.g., of depressive symptoms). These individual networks may differ in architecture (i.e., whether and how strongly symptoms are connected) and in the resulting dynamics: some networks will easily end up in a pathological state (e.g., depressed) while others will never leave the healthy state. In previous work, I have successfully used this approach to explain important empirical phenomena of psychopathology, such as comorbidity and spontaneous recovery, and have shown that empirical evidence from various sources is consistent with network theory. Although the theory is highly promising, its accompanying psychometric toolbox is still underdeveloped. Specifically, currently available methods have not been vigorously tested in terms of how well they perform under different circumstances (e.g., small sample sizes), and much needed methods and models have simply not been developed at all yet (e.g., methods to compare weighted networks). Therefore, the primary aim of this proposal is to develop network psychometrics, a toolbox that contains an array of validated methods designed to track the architecture and dynamics of individual networks. In addition, the resulting techniques will be applied to mood disorders. With these methods, I will be able to dig deeper than in earlier work into the mysteries of mood disorders with the potential to, for example, predict when people might be on the brink of collapsing into a depressed state.
