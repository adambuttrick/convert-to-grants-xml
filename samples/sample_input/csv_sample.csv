A stored-grain ecosystem is a man-made ecosystem where interactions among physical, chemical and biological variables cause deterioration of grain. Thus, an enhanced understating of these interactions is critical to developing innovative management strategies to preserve grain quality. A comprehensive ecosystem model must include simulation of heat transfer; insect movement; insect population dynamics; gaseous diffusion, convection, and sorption; moisture transfer; and the production of carbon dioxide, moisture, and heat by grain and pests. During this study, we will determine the movement of adults and larvae of insects under temperature, moisture, and carbon dioxide gradients in the horizontal and vertical directions using columns filled with wheat; develop and validate a mathematical model of insect movement incorporating the effects of temperature, moisture and carbon dioxide gradients on their movement; develop a model of transfer of moisture from spoiling grain; determine the free-convective velocity of gases through bulks of grain; and develop and validate a comprehensive model of stored-grain ecosystems. The comprehensive model will permit accurate prediction of storage problems before they occur and allow action to be taken to prevent grain spoilage, and thus help the farmers, grain handlers, and grain storage managers in preserving the stored-grain, and help consulting engineers in designing proper storage systems.  In addition, the results of this research will help Canada to maintain its reputation for marketing high quality grain free of insects, pesticide residues and mycotoxins to domestic and export buyers."

We will investigate: (i) Giant planet growth in a realistic setting of a primordial disk. The most important issue is  to compute the currently poorly constrained growth rate, by including both the gas supply from a realistically modeled (3-D) nebula, and the radiation transfer in an extended, rotating protoplanetary envelope. (ii)  Migration of protoplanets in primordial  disks,  which results in the observed distribution of star-planet distances. A new important fast mode of inward and outward migration called migration type III will be studied numerically and analytically. We will use sophisticated hydrodynamical numerical codes run on supercomputers. Our study of planet growth and migration will result in novel perspectives and scenarios of planet formation, and allow putting our solar system in a broader perspective of similar and dissimilar extrasolar cousins. (iii) Physics and evolution of dust-dominated disks, dust-gas and radiation coupling, including spontaneous axial symmetry breaking in disks of large opacity. Together with studies of planet-disk coupling this investigation will help interpret the types of dust structures found in recent images of young planetary systems. It will be useful  for extrasolar planet searches with new observatories, and provide a diagnostic tools for the presence and distribution in young planetary systems of those components which are notoriously difficult to detect directly: planets, comets, asteroids, and gas. (iv) Formation of Kuiper belt and Oort cloud, taking into account the stellar flybys in the star cluster in which the sun has formed, as well as a later instability of the solar system that resulted in the enlargement of the Oort cloud to its current size and the late heavy bombardment of planets by comets.

We intend to take advantage of the data-set from the OSIRIS instrument - a spectrograph and imager - on the Odin satellite. The data inversion methods will use both the tomographic algorithms developed by the University of Saskatchewan group as well new approaches for weak emissions embedded in a strong solar background. These analysis procedures allow both the vertical and horizontal structure of the measured quantities to be retrieved. Previous results show that ozone exhibits significant vertical and horizontal structure. We intend to validate the derived mesospheric ozone concentrations with those derived from the optical spectrograph; this latter is now possible as reliable ultra-violet radiance models have been developed by various members of the University of Saskatchewan aeronomy team. The spectrograph observations of the OH resonance emission at 308 nm have been, and will be, used to provide new information on the OH (X, v=0) populations and water vapour concentrations. We will compare our derived water vapour concentrations with those derived from the OSIRIS observations of the direct Ly-? photolysis of water vapour. We also intend to study the diurnal variation of water vapour and the OH 'hot' line observations made by OSIRIS. We intend to relate the observed mesospheric ozone structures with possible loss mechanisms; we believe that these are related to hydrogen, and so water vapour, chemistry, and enhance the spectrograph water vapour profiles. It is expected that the findings from this research will provide new information on the transport of hydrogen through the mesosphere and into the thermosphere. We will use the OSIRIS observations to derive the mesospheric temperature profile in the presence of PMC's. A major objective of the entire research program is to enhance the training of highly qualified personnel."

By studying the genes encoded in these vital cellular components involved in energy production, researchers have found that in several eukaryotic lineages, including green algae and land plants, the chloroplast (cp) and mitochondrial (mt) genomes exhibit considerable diversity in size, structure, gene content, gene order and intron content. Our group is determining and analyzing the complete sequences of organelle genomes from green algae, which range in size from 20,000 to 350,000 bases. All living green plants (Viridiplantae) are divided into two phyla: the Chlorophyta, comprising the bulk of the green algae, and the Streptophyta, comprising the green algae from the class Charophyceae and all land plants. We have recently shown that the cp genome is evolving much more conservatively in the Streptophyta than in the Chlorophyta and that the cp genome of land plants inherited a myriad of traits from their charophycean green algal ancestors. In contrast, the mt genome sustained radical changes during the evolution of both chlorophytes and streptophytes and it appears that land plant mtDNAs inherited only a few structural characters from charophycean green algae. The aims of the proposed research are two-fold: (1) to understand how streptophyte and chlorophyte organelle genomes diverged over evolutionary time and (2) to resolve the branching order of problematic green algal lineages in the tree of life. Complete cpDNA and mtDNA sequences from representatives of various green algal lineages will be determined, decoded, and compared to their previously sequenced green plant homologs. Using a phylogenic framework inferred from whole organelle genomes, we will be reconstruct scenarios of gene losses, gene rearrangements and intron gains/losses. The information gained will help us to decipher the forces that shape organelle genomes. This information is also crucial for understanding how green algae evolved and gave rise to land plants. We expect that the proposed studies will represent a major Canadian contribution in the area of organelle genomics."

The success and failure of early pregnancy is of fundamental and economic importance in all the domestic animals but the horse is an especially good species in which to study its underlying physiology; the equine embryo can be flushed from the uterus throughout the second to fourth weeks without harming the mare and, also, has structural and functional features that are not found in the embryos of other species. One such feature is the embryo's production and use of steroid hormones that we believe to be very important in influencing its local environment. This 'steroidogenesis' and steroid metabolism is being studied in detail. Another unusual feature is a thin, tough, transparent capsule that envelops the hollow ball of cells (the conceptus) as it expands rapidly from a diameter of less that 0.2 mm to one of more than 20 mm during its first two weeks in the uterus. Having described the biochemical makeup of the capsule, we now want to test our idea that it is vital for attaching the conceptus to the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) where the placenta will later develop. We think that this adhesion involves particular sugar molecules in the capsule and protein molecules on the endometrium and will test this notion using the very latest biochemical and molecular techniques on tissues collected from pregnant mares.  In order to discover what goes wrong when pregnancy fails, we use a model system of 'compromised' pregnancy; at the end of the second week of pregnancy we treat some mares with a prostaglandin that reduces progesterone production by the ovary.  Despite the treatment, the conceptus can survive in the uterus for another 3-4 days after which it is recovered and compared with conceptuses from 'control' mares not treated with prostaglandin.  The comparisons of conceptuses and uterine materials from normal and compromised pregnancies are gradually enabling us to pinpoint the differences in proteins and steroid hormone activities that are associated with pregnancy failure."
